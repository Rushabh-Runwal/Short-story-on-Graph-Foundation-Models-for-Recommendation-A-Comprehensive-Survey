# Short Story Assignment: Graph Foundation Models

## 📄 Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for my short story assignment on the paper:

> **Title:** Graph Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey  
> **Authors:** X. Wang, Y. Zhang, J. Lee, J. Tang, J. Zhou  
> **arXiv ID:** [arXiv:2502.08346v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08346)  
> **Published:** February 2025

This paper provides an in-depth survey of **Graph Foundation Models (GFMs)**—large-scale pretrained models designed to generalize across diverse graph-based tasks. The article summarizes key architectural approaches, pretraining paradigms, benchmarks, evaluation strategies, applications, and challenges in the emerging field of GFMs.

## 📚 Article Summary

In the Medium article, I cover:

- What are Graph Foundation Models?
- Why foundation models are needed for graphs
- Key architectures (Graph Transformers, hybrid models)
- Pretraining objectives (node masking, edge prediction, contrastive learning)
- Benchmarks and evaluation datasets
- Applications across drug discovery, knowledge graphs, social networks
- Ablation findings and empirical insights
- Open challenges and future directions
- My reflections on the field's potential

The article is written in accessible, non-technical language for a broad audience while retaining depth on architecture and research insights.
